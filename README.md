# Solarium

Welcome to Solarium, a frontend web app that uses the majesty of CSS to let you explore the Solar System!

The landing page contains a model of each planet's relative orbital period.  Users can switch views for to-scale representations of the planetary sizes and distances from the sun.  Clicking on any of the planet's names in the navbar will bring up some more information about each individual planet.
