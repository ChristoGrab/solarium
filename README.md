# Solarium

Welcome to Solarium, a frontend web app that uses the majesty of CSS to let you explore the Solar System!

The landing page contains a model of each planet's relative orbital period.  Note that distances and sizes are obviously not to scale, but orbital periods are accurate relative to each other.  If you want to read some more on an individual planet, just use the navbar to select one for a zoomed in view and some fun facts!
